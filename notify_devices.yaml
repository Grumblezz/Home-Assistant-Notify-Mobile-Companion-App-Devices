    **Struggling to make use of the notification options of the [Home Assistant Companion App](https://companion.home-assistant.io/) on your mobile device?**
    **Then this script can help you in the right direction.**
    ***
    For more instructions or questions take a look in the [Home Assistant Community forum topic](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/notify-mobile-companion-app-devices/512487)
    Ever gone through all of the options of the [Companion app](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic)?, then you may have lost your self 🤔 in all of the options you can pick you might be dazzled 😵 what you can do with it, let alone reapply it in another automation 😕.
    ## Features of this script ##
     * Use an UI to select options instead of reading the documentation 😵‍💫🥴🤔🥲🥱😫😝
     * Able to send notifications to one or more specific device(s) or all devices
     * Send notifications based on the device(s) state: 
       * Home
       * Away
       * Both (Home and Away)
     * Send notifications to Android and iOS devices (!). The script then filters the input to what is supported per platform. Thus Android features are not send to iOS devices and visa versa.
     * Send notifications with actionable actions. The script then filters the actions per platform. Thus Android actions are not send to iOS devices and visa versa.
     * Support notifications with camera images/live feed for camera devices, also for [Google Nest camera devices](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nest/) (!).
    ***
    ### Background ###
    *I noticed over the last year or so that I made more and more use of the notifications via the Home Assistant Companion App on the various mobile devices, and I loved it so much that I applied it for many automations. During that journey I was struggling with adding and fixing the code in various automations (there are +/- 40 automations where I was using it) so maintaining all of it was a nightmare. And so it began, I made one script that has all the logic in it to notify all or specific devices, which have the app installed, and let the automation call the script. 
    And so during that journey I also wanted to use the selectors to have a UI to guide the process with all sorts of options.*

    ## Examples ##
    ***
    ### Example 1 ###
    Send a persistent notification, that the user can’t remove.
    ```
    service: script.notify_devices
    data:
      notify_home_or_away: Both
      data_notification_icon: mdi:human-greeting-variant
      notify_title: Example 1
      notify_message: Send a persistent notification, that the user can't remove
      data_group: Example
      data_tag: Use this tag when you need to remove it
      data_importance: high
      data_sticky: true
      data_persistent: true
    ```
    ### Example 2 ###
    Send a clean_persistent notification, so the notification is removed.
    ```
    service: script.notify_devices
    data:
      notify_home_or_away: Both
      data_tag: Use this tag when you need to remove it
      data_importance: high
      notify_message: clear_notification
    ```
    ### Example 3 ###
    Send a notification with camera image file. The data_camera can accept various
    options, but the results are different for Android or iOS.

    data:
      notify_home_or_away: Both
      data_notification_icon: mdi:cctv
      notify_title: Camera
      notify_message: Send a Nest camera picture notification
      data_group: Camera
      data_importance: high

        {{'/api/nest/event_media/{{'~'trigger.event.data.device_id'~'}}/{{'~'trigger.event.data.nest_event_id'~'}}/thumbnail'}}
    ```
    ### Example 4 ###
    Actionable notifications are a unique type of notification as they allow the user to add buttons to the notification which can then send an event to Home Assistant once clicked. This event can then be used in an automation allowing you to perform a wide variety of actions. These notifications can be sent to either iOS or Android.
    Some useful examples of actionable notifications:
     * A notification is sent whenever motion is detected in your home while you're away or asleep. A "Sound Alarm" action button is displayed alongside the notification, that when tapped, will sound your burglar alarm.
     * Someone rings your front doorbell. You receive a notification with a live camera stream of the visitor outside along with action buttons to lock or unlock your front door.
     * Receive a notification whenever your garage door opens with action buttons to open or close the garage.

    **This script filters the actions per device. This means you can send information to Android and iOS device simultaneously 🙂 .**
